          <h3>Responsibility</h3>
          <p>All our associates are empowered to take direct responsibility for results, exercise initiative and judgment, and make decisions. By recruiting people well suited to their roles &ndash; and trusting them &ndash; we hold associates accountable for their own high standards.</p>

      <section style="">
        <div class="main-info">
          <h3>Mutuality</h3>
          <p>We measure our business relationships on the degree to which benefits are created. They take many different forms and need not be strictly financial. We strive to create mutually beneficial partnerships. Our actions should never be at the expense, economic or otherwise, of others with whom we work.</p>

      <section style="">
        <div class="main-info">
          <h3>Efficiency</h3>
          <p>Our strength lies in our ability to organize all assets &ndash; physical, financial and human &ndash; for maximum productivity. Our products and services are made and delivered with the highest quality, at the least possible cost, with the lowest consumption of resources.</p>

      <section style="">
        <div class="main-info">
          <h3>Freedom</h3>
          <p>Our family ownership is a deliberate choice. Other companies have exchanged a portion of their freedom by selling stocks or incurring restrictive debt, in order to extend growth. We believe growth and prosperity can be achieved another way. </p>
